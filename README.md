# image-sequence-streaming

Realtime, non-linear animation playback for interactive pieces. 

## What are image sequences?

Image sequences are very similar video files, but are designed to be accessed randomly, so frames can be played back in any order you would like. This makes them very useful for creating interactive content, such as draggable animations composed from many individual images (frames). 

On mobile devices image sequences are a powerful tool for creating interactive content with outstanding visual quality. For example, creating a rotatable 3D product display:

![car image sequence](screenshots/screen_small.jpg)


## What is sequence streaming?

Most image sequence approaches out there (using UIImageView or custom CGImage code) require the entire animation, or many frames, to be loaded into memory at once. This method has several difficult drawbacks:
- Long load times.
- Large memory footprint.
- Limitations on animation length
- Slow playback speeds

This project aims to overcome these limitations by streaming individual frames into memory, as needed. This approach has several advantageous:
- No load times.
- Constant small memory footprint (a few frames at most) regardless of sequence length.  
- Nearly unlimited sequence length.
- Smooth framerates (Often 30-60 FPS which is faster than conventional video playback)
- Scaling playback - lower resolution animations can be displayed in a larger view improve performance and reduce data size.

The main tradeoff for this approach, is that a collection of JPEGs need to be precompiled into a single file using a command line tool. Thanks to JPEGs effecient compression, the filesizes are very small. 

**Note** that this project originally used an alternative image compression mechanism and was much more complex. The idea was that 
if the images on disk matched the GPU format as closely as possible, this would minimze the refresh time for a frame. It turns
out that disk bandwidth is more important than decompression time. JPGs are the fastest because they compress well
and the iOS devices have dedicated hardware for decoding them.

## Usage:

Compiling a folder of JPEGs into a sequence file in terminal:

```
sequencebuild folder_of_jpgs/ output.seq
```

Loading a sequence file:

```Objective-C
// loading from a compiled sequence file
ISSequence* sequence = [ISSequence sequenceNamed:@"sequence.seq"];

// loading from a collection of jpgs of the format car_0001.jpg
ISSequence* sequence = [ISSequence sequenceFromNameFormat:@"source/car_%04li.jpg"
                                               startFrame:1
                                               frameCount:155];

```

Creating a draggable interactive playback view:

```Objective-C
ISSequenceDragView* view = [[ISSequenceDragView alloc] initWithSequence:sequence
                                                        refreshInterval:2 /* 30 FPS refresh rate */
                                                        useTextureCache:YES /* texture cache is an optional core video optimization */
                                                                  loops:YES
                                                                  range:[sequence range]
                                                          dragDirection:kISSequnceDragDirectionHorizontal
                                                        dragSensitivity:2.0
                                                               delegate:nil];

[self addSubview:view];

```

Creating a grid position playback view:

```Objective-C

/*
 when touch is enabled for grid view touches cause the view to load the grid cell nearest to the touch
 */

ISSequenceGridView* view = [[ISSequenceGridView alloc] initWithSequence:sequence
                                                        refreshInterval:2
                                                        useTextureCache:YES
                                                                  range:[sequence range]
                                                           framesPerRow:21
                                                           touchEnabled:YES];


[self addSubview:view];

```

**Note:** Simulator performance is not a good indicator of device performance in general, and especially in this project. Always be sure to test on device.


### Components:
- A macOS command line tool for compiling a collection of JPEG images into an optimized sequence file. (sequencebuild)
- An Objective-C class for loading compiled sequences or folders of JPEG. (ISSequence)
- UIView base class for displaying interactive sequences with OpenGL ES and Core Video.
- Interactive UIView classes for linear playback, horizontal and vertical drag control, and grid cell control, (ISSequenceView...)
- An example project and sample animation sequence.

## Credits:

 Thanks to my friend **Steve Glauser** for creating and rendering the sample image sequence.

## Example:

Due to filesize the resolution of the sample animation included in this project has been limited. The original resolution was reduced from 1024x768 to 960x720 and every other frame was removed. In your own apps you can safely expect to display higher quality animations.
